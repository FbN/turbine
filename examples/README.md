# Examples

To run the examples first install the dependencies.

```
npm install
```

The command should be executed inside the `examples` directory.

Then each individual example can be.

```
npm start ${name}
```

Where `name` is the name of the example. The name is equivalent to the
name of the directory the example is located in. For example:

```
npm start counters
```

The TodoMVC example has additional dependencies that has to be
installed by running `npm install` inside the `todo` directory.
